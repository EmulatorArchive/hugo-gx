The emulator is provided as a .dol which is a Gamecube Executable. You only need to load and run
the DOL on your GC or WII (Gamecube Pad needed) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

.Wii versions is also provided: they have been compiled to run in Wii mode and should be loaded
using your prefered method (Twilight hack,...). This version provides extra features such as native SD 
slot access and Wiimote support.

SDCARD users should create a directory named "hugo" at the root of the SDCARD.
Inside this directory, you have to create then a subdirectory named "roms" to put all your roms.
You should also create a subdirectory named "saves" where SRAM and FreezeState files will be saved.

If using a DVD to load the roms, the format of the image you burned must be ISO9960
or you won't be able to read from it. The maximal readable size is 1.35GB for Gamecube users
and 4.7GB for Wii users.

.Please note that only the Gamecube version of this emulator has DVD support, and you need a mod-chipped console to run DVD-R.


IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory.
